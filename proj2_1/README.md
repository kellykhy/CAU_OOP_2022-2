**Problem1.** Complete implementing inf_int class that represents infinite precision integer and its operations. The
specification of inf_int is provided to you in "inf_int.h". You should add its implementation in
"inf_int.cpp". Test the correctness of your implementation by writing "main.cpp". "inf_int.h" and an
example of "main.cpp" are downloadable from our class website. After compilation, your code should generate
correct result. The result of this problem should be submitting compilable source code package (inf_int.h,
inf_int.cpp, main.cpp, .sln files (files for opening with visual studio 2010 or 20xx)). FYI, I will test your
code by replacing the "main.cpp" with my own main.cpp files that contain various test cases and checking
whether your code generates correct result according to my own main.cpp. You have to effectively use dynamic
memory allocation(new) and deallocation(delete) for handling the variable sizes of infinite precision integer
numbers.
